# Vietnamese to Sign Language Translator

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a Vietnamese to Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) translation system using a web-based interface built with Streamlit. The application bridges the communication gap between Vietnamese speakers and the deaf community by converting Vietnamese text into Pakistan Sign Language video representations.

## üí° The Idea

The core concept addresses a critical accessibility challenge: **converting Vietnamese text to sign language structure**. This project specifically focuses on:

- **Grammatical Structure Analysis**: Understanding the differences between Vietnamese grammar and sign language structure
- **Cross-Language Translation**: Building a pipeline that converts Vietnamese sentences to sign language through an intermediate language (Urdu)
- **Visual Communication**: Generating actual sign language videos that can be used for communication with the deaf community

This work is particularly valuable for improving accessibility and communication between Vietnamese speakers and sign language users.

### Grammatical Structure Comparison

Understanding the fundamental differences between spoken Vietnamese and Vietnamese Sign Language is crucial for effective translation. The table below illustrates key grammatical contrasts:

| Grammatical Feature | Spoken Vietnamese | Vietnamese Sign Language(s) (General) |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Primary Word Order** | S-V-O (Subject-Verb-Object)<br>Example: *T√¥i ƒë·ªçc s√°ch.* (I read book.) | Topic-Comment (often OSV or Time-OSV)<br>Example: *S√ÅCH, T√îI ƒê·ªåC.* (BOOK, I READ.) The topic (the book) is established first, then a comment is made about it. |
| **Verbs** | No conjugation. Tense/aspect is marked by helper words.<br>Example: *ƒë√£* (past), *ƒëang* (present progressive), *s·∫Ω* (future). | No conjugation. Verbs can be modified for aspect (e.g., repetitive action by repeating the sign). Some verbs are directional‚Äîthe movement of the sign indicates the subject and object (e.g., the sign for GIVE moves from me to you). |
| **Adjectives/Modifiers** | Follow the noun.<br>Example: *Ng√¥i nh√† m√†u ƒë·ªè.* (House color red.) | Often follow the noun. However, the adjective can be emphasized through facial expression and sign intensity.<br>Example: *NH√Ä, ƒê·ªé.* (HOUSE, RED.) |
| **Questions** | Question words (*ai, g√¨, ·ªü ƒë√¢u*) or ending particles (*kh√¥ng, √†*).<br>Example: *B·∫°n ƒÉn c∆°m ch∆∞a?* (You eat rice yet?) | Non-Manual Markers (NMMs). Wh-questions (who, what, where) are accompanied by furrowed eyebrows. Yes/No questions are marked by raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt. |
| **Negation** | Negative word *kh√¥ng* placed before the verb.<br>Example: *T√¥i kh√¥ng ƒë·ªçc s√°ch.* (I not read book.) | Negative sign (like KH√îNG or SAI) and/or a negative headshake performed simultaneously with the verb sign. The headshake is a grammatical component. |
| **Classifiers** | Yes, uses classifiers for counting.<br>Example: *m·ªôt **con** m√®o* (one cat), *m·ªôt **c√°i** b√†n* (one table). | Yes, uses classifiers extensively. But they are handshapes that represent the size, shape, or category of an object. For example, a "flat hand" classifier might represent a table or a book. |
| **Use of Space** | Linear and one-dimensional. Word order is everything. | Three-dimensional and spatial. Locations in the signing space can be used to represent people, places, or ideas. Pointing to a location refers back to what was established there (spatial grammar). |
| **Facial Expressions** | Adds emotional context, but is not strictly grammatical. | Crucial Grammatical Component (NMMs). Eyebrow position, mouth morphemes, and head tilts change the meaning of a sentence, turning a statement into a question or modifying an adverb (e.g., signing CAR with puffed cheeks can mean "a large car" or "a long drive"). |

**Key Insights from this Comparison:**

- **Spatial vs. Linear**: Sign languages utilize three-dimensional space for grammar, while spoken Vietnamese relies on linear word order
- **Non-Manual Markers**: Facial expressions and body language are grammatically essential in sign language, not just emotional additions
- **Topic-Comment Structure**: Sign languages often establish the topic first, then provide commentary, differing from Vietnamese S-V-O structure
- **Directional Verbs**: Sign language verbs can encode subject-object relationships through movement direction
- **Visual Classifiers**: Sign language classifiers are visual representations of object properties, unlike Vietnamese word-based classifiers

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Solution

### Architecture Overview

The translation system follows a multi-stage pipeline:

```
Vietnamese Text ‚Üí English/Urdu Translation ‚Üí Text Processing ‚Üí Sign Language Video
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Translation Layer**
- **Google Translator**: Converts Vietnamese text to Urdu (intermediate language)
- **Language Bridge**: Uses Urdu as the bridge language to PSL since direct Vietnamese-to-PSL translation isn't available

#### 2. **Text Processing**
- **Token Disambiguation**: Replaces ambiguous words with clearer alternatives
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation and normalizes text format
- **Safe Tokenization**: Ensures compatibility with sign language translation model

#### 3. **Sign Language Generation**
- **Concatenative Synthesis Model**: Generates sign language videos from processed text
- **Pakistan Sign Language (PSL)**: Target sign language for video output
- **Video Format**: Outputs MP4 videos showing sign language gestures

### Key Technologies

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for user interface
- **Deep Translator**: Google Translate API integration for Vietnamese-to-Urdu translation
