# Vietnamese NLP Pipeline for Sign Language Processing

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline specifically designed for Vietnamese text processing, with a focus on supporting sign language conversion. The application provides a web-based interface built with Streamlit that demonstrates core NLP techniques including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and tone mark processing.

## üí° The Idea

The project addresses two main objectives:

1. **Vietnamese Text Processing Pipeline**: Build a robust pipeline for processing Vietnamese text including tokenization, POS tagging, and tone mark handling with sample sentence testing.

2. **Sign Language Processing Foundation**: Analyze grammatical structure differences between Vietnamese and sign language, laying the groundwork for a system that converts Vietnamese sentences to sign language structure.

This work is particularly valuable for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, as it provides tools for better text processing and potentially facilitates communication through sign language conversion.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modular components for better maintainability and reusability:

### Module Descriptions

#### `app.py`
- **Purpose**: Main Streamlit web application providing the user interface
- **Features**: 
  - Interactive text input with sample sentences
  - Real-time processing and results display
  - Comprehensive POS tag reference guide
  - Responsive two-column layout for results

#### `process_vietnamese_text.py`
- **Purpose**: Core NLP processing pipeline
- **Features**:
  - Vietnamese text tokenization using PyVi
  - Part-of-speech tagging
  - Integration with tone removal functionality
  - Structured output with detailed results

#### `remove_tones.py`
- **Purpose**: Utility for Vietnamese tone mark removal
- **Features**:
  - Unicode normalization (NFD) for diacritic separation
  - Clean removal of Vietnamese tone marks
  - Useful for text normalization and search optimization

## Technical Solution

### Core Technologies

- **PyVi**: Vietnamese NLP library for tokenization and POS tagging
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for interactive UI
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation for result display
- **Unicode**: Standard text normalization for tone processing

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Tokenization**: 
   - Segments Vietnamese text into meaningful tokens
   - Handles compound words with underscore joining (e.g., `H√†_N·ªôi`)
   - Uses PyVi's `ViTokenizer` for accurate segmentation

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**:
   - Identifies grammatical roles of each word
   - Provides detailed POS tags (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)
   - Uses PyVi's `ViPosTagger` for Vietnamese-specific tagging

3. **Tone Mark Processing**:
   - Removes Vietnamese diacritical marks (d·∫•u)
   - Normalizes text for search and comparison
   - Preserves original text structure

### Output Structure

The pipeline returns a comprehensive dictionary containing:
- `original_text`: Input text unchanged
- `tokenized_string`: Text with properly segmented compound words
- `tokens_list`: Individual tokens as a list
- `pos_tags`: Word-tag pairs for grammatical analysis
- `no_tones_text`: Text with tone marks removed
